Summary

We built a website that overcomes the problem of less education in space with the help of digital tools . We had designed an interacting website where people could gain and understand about NASA's earth science and its endeavour . Our website consists of information about the activities, research and observations done by NASA and also we have an interactive chatbot which helps a new user to gain knowledge and information regarding NASA’s observation and it’s Apollo Mission. This project would help everyone to know about NASA’s observation and its missions.

How We Addressed This Challenge

Regarding space progression as most of the people aren’t aware of NASA’s contribution towards space like the progression they made or in tackling the challenges or the observations they made and much more. Our project shares the progression and contribution made by NASA in the field of space through digital interactive tools. We feel this is important because the progression achieved by NASA in the field of space should be known to everyone so that people could gain knowledge on what kind of challenge they are approaching and providing solutions. So we had developed a website about the information and observations done by NASA and also an interactive chatbot that explains about the missions made by NASA. We hope to make this website reach everyone so that everyone could learn about milestones done by NASA in an interactive way.

How We Developed This Project

To solve the problem statement “Mission to Planet Earth: A Digital History” We developed a Website. The frontend part of our Website is developed with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The backend part of our website in developed with Mysql(Database) and PHP .Our chat bot is devepoled with Microsoft Azure cognitive services and general questions about Apollo missions are trained to our chat bot.

How We Used Space Agency Data in This Project

We used NASA’s articles of Earth to give better understanding of our planet to the users
https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-earth/en/

We used NASA’s Apollo data to train the chatbot
https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo11.html

And we also used Frequntly asked questions to train our chatbot
